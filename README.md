# Deploy NodeJs App to Azure Kubernetes service cluster by using GitHub actions
Sample workflow which uses GitHub actions to build and deploy a NodeJS app to a **Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)** cluster

## End to end workflow for building container images and deploying to an AKS cluster

```yaml
on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@master
    
    # Connect to Azure Container registry (ACR)
    - uses: azure/docker-login@v1
      with:
        login-server: demo.azurecr.io
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} 
        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
    
    # Docker build and push to a Azure Container registry (ACR)
    - run: |
        docker build . -t demo.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}
        docker push demo.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}

        container-registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        container-registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        secret-name: demo-k8s-secret
    
    # Deploy app to AKS

          manifests/deployment.yml
          manifests/service.yml
        images: |
          demo.azurecr.io/k8sdemo:${{ github.sha }}

```

### To test drive this sample NodeJS app using GitHub actions for AKS 

* You can create a separate branch using the sample code in master 
* To deploy the sample web app to your AKS cluster:
    * Create an Azure SPN by running the following command.
    ```yaml
    $ az ad sp create-for-rbac --name build-demo-k8s --scopes /subscriptions/avb1291-****-46be-****-70349146ddrr/resourceGroups/build-demo --role contributor --sdk-auth
    ```
    In the sample workflow of this repo we are using Azure SPN but other options are also supported. You can also use Kubeconfig [az aks get-credentials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/aks?view=azure-cli-latest#az-aks-get-credentials) or for any other cluster refer to [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/organize-cluster-access-kubeconfig/) documentation. The [`azure/k8s-actions/k8s-set-context`](https://github.com/Azure/k8s-actions/tree/master/k8s-set-context) action supports Kubernetes service account as well.
    
    * Define a new secret in the [repository](https://github.com/bbq-beets/k8s/settings/secrets) >> “Add a new secret”  
    * Paste the output of the 'az ad sp...' command into the secret value field and add your secret.
    ```json
    {
  "clientId": "7*********8",
  "clientSecret": "******",
  "subscriptionId": "qvb11291-****-****-****-70349**46dre8",
  "tenantId": "72****bf-****-****-****-*****011db4*",
  "activeDirectoryEndpointUrl": "https://login.microsoftonline.com",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/",
  "activeDirectoryGraphResourceId": "https://graph.windows.net/",
  "sqlManagementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net:8443/",
  "galleryEndpointUrl": "https://gallery.azure.com/",
  "managementEndpointUrl": "https://management.core.windows.net/"
  }
  ```
    * Similarly get the username and password of your container registry and create secrets for them. For Azure Container registry refer to admin [account document](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/container-registry/container-registry-authentication#admin-account) for username and password.
    * Now in the workflow file in your branch: `.github/workflows/workflow.yml`
        * Replace the secret name with your secret (Refer below)
    * Review the **container registry url and manifest file paths**. 
    
    ```yaml      
      # Connect to a container registry
    - uses: azure/docker-login@v1
      with:
        login-server: demo.azurecr.io
        username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }} 
        password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
    ```
    
    ```yaml      
      # Set the target AKS cluster. 
    - uses: azure/k8s-actions/k8s-set-context@master
      with:
        kubeconfig: ${{ secrets.KUBE_CONFIG }}
    ```
    
    ```yaml
    # Create imagepullsecret
    - uses: azure/k8s-create-secret@v1
      with:
        container-registry-url: demo.azurecr.io
        container-registry-username: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_USERNAME }}
        container-registry-password: ${{ secrets.REGISTRY_PASSWORD }}
        secret-name: demo-k8s-secret
     ```

## Build and deploy
In the sample workflow above we have setup build and deploy in the same job. You can use multiple jobs as well. For example one job for build followed by a job for deploying to staging cluster or deploying to production.

```yaml
jobs:
  my_first_job:
    name: My first job
  my_second_job:
    name: My second job
```
